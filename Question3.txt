In order to validate the results, a pilot study must be performed 
using samples or reference materials with known variants.

During this phase, the initial performance of the pipeline can be
determined. The pipeline may perform adequately in its initial
configuration. Alternatively, the pipeline may need refinement,
and whether refinement can be achieved is dependent on
whether relevant parameters can be altered in the software.
Modifications of software may require programming expertise;
in some commercial software, options for modifying parameters
can be achieved through a graphical user interface. Through this
iterative process, the performance and limitations of the pipeline
are determined.1
