A)  I would write a console application triggered by a cron job (linux) or scheduled task(windows) to transfer the data.  This job should run weekly, when the NGS results are produced.
The PCR must be run prior to the NGS.
B)  During the transfer, a validation/cleaning process should be performed.  A log should be produced by  the console app that describes any errors during
the transfer process.  The log shoud emailed to the data analyst if errors are encountered.
