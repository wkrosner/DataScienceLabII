A)  Matching errors can be avoided by setting the primary key on the id field.  This will ensure that only 1 record is present in each table for a given ID.  If there is 
more than 1 record in the PCR and NGS files, this is a problem!!! how do you identify the correct user.
B)  Log file should contain counts of successful and unsucessful matches.  Unsuccessful matches should be emailed to the lab staff to correct.
